Tiago graduated in <b>pharmaceutical sciences (PharmD) from the University of Lisbon</b>. He then completed his <b>PhD in medicinal chemistry under the supervision of Dr Francisca Lopes</b>, where he worked on the computational design, synthesis and profiling of potential anti-plasmodial small molecules acting through cytochrome <i>bc</i><sub>1</sub>. Next, he moved to the <b>computer-assisted drug design group led by Prof Gisbert Schneider at the ETH Zürich</b> where he worked as a postdoctoral researcher on a range of collaborative projects – spanning from <i>de novo</i> design and microfluidic-assisted syntheses to machine learning for deorphanization of natural products – with both academia and industry. He then returned to Portugal to work as Marie Curie Fellow and senior researcher in the group of <b>Prof Gonçalo Bernardes at the Instituto de Medicina Molecular</b>. There, he co-developed small molecule–ligand conjugates and built machine learning workflows to unveil the modes of action of several high value natural products with anticancer activity. His research resulted in the VC-funded, biotech company <b>TargTex S.A.</b> where he acts as co-founder. 
<br />
<br /> 
He then moved to the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon to establish the DigiChem Lab. He became an Assistant Professor at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2022 and was promoted to <b>Associate Professor in 2024</b>. He is a <b>member at the Acceleration Consortium at the University of Toronto</b>, a Mercator fellow at the Molecular Machine Learning Priority Program by DFG and a ECB at the <i>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry</i>. He works on the digitalization of chemical sciences, with special focus on merging computation with experimental chemical biology, organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and nanotechnology. His ultimate goal is translating science from bench to clinic to improve healthcare.
<br />
<br />
He has published >75 papers with >20 as senior or co-senior author (h-index 33) in journals, such as <i>Nature, Nature Chemistry, Nature Communications, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Reviews Chemistry</i> and others, delivered >70 presentations at national and international meetings and is inventor in 4 patents (1 granted in the USA, Japan, Australia, EU, Aurasia and is licensed).
